**ðŸ”°  Design of Boost DC-DC Converter (Capstone Project)**

Project details:

In a UPS design a boost converter is required to have an output voltage of 150 V 
dc and supply a load current of 1.5 A. The input battery voltage is 12 V dc. A control 
circuit adjusts the duty ratio to keep the output voltage constant. Select the switching 
frequency (n+Z) kHz; where, n=1, 25, and 50 and Z= last digit of your 3-digit Roll No. 
Determine the value for the inductor such that the variation in inductor current is no 
more than 40 percent of the average inductor current for all operating conditions. 
Determine the values of ideal capacitor such that the output voltage ripple is no more 
than 2 percent for all operating conditions. Also determine the efficiency of the converter.
Simulate the design and compare the values of inductors and capacitors, output voltage 
and inductor current ripple for each switching frequency. Show the final wave shapes 
of i) Input voltage, ii) Gate Pulses, iii) inductor current, iv) load and output capacitor 
currents, v) output voltage for each cases.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Describe the effect the switching control signal frequency has on the output voltage 
and current of a boost chopper. Explain.
2. A boost chopper is powered by a 12V dc power supply. What is the output voltage 
range of this chopper if the duty cycle can vary between 20 and 95%?
3. With neat sketch of the circuit diagram draw the typical wave shapes of input voltage, 
gate pulses, inductor current, switch and diode currents and voltages, load and output 
capacitor currents and output voltage waveforms of DC-DC Boost converter. (Use graph
